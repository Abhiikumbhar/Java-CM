1] List down some of java methodâ€™s where method overloading is used.
Ans:
	1. Math operations-  Methods like sum(), multiply() where the number of arguments might differ.
	2. Utility methods: Methods that perform similar tasks but on different data types or parameter combinations.


2] Overload method by changing data type of argument and keeping same number of argument.
Ans: 

	class Test {
		public int sum(int a, int b) 
		{
			return a+b;
		}
		public int sum(float a, float b)
		{
			return a+b;
		}
	}


3] Calculate area of Circle, Triangle, Rectangle using method overloading.
Ans:
	class area {
		public int calculateArea(double radius)
		{
			return 3.14 * radius * radius;
		}
		public int calculateArea(double base, double height)
		{
       		return 0.5 * base * height;
    	}
    	public int calculateArea(double length, double width) 
		{
       		return length * width;
    	}
	}

	
4] What is the advantage of method overloading
Ans:
	1. overloading makes the code more readable and concise.
	2. It allows us to reuse the same method for different purposes.
	3. It can improve performance by reducing the number of method calls.
